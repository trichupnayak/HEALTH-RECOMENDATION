Project Overview:
This project is an intelligent Health Recommendation System that takes user symptoms as input and provides possible health conditions, along with suggested precautions and personalized diet recommendations. The goal is to provide quick and accessible healthcare guidance using rule-based logic and basic machine learning.

Objective:
Create a system that suggests health conditions based on symptoms entered by the user

Provide relevant precautions and dietary advice

Build a user-friendly interface to make it easy for anyone to use the system

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, sklearn

Interface: Streamlit

Development Tool: Jupyter Notebook

Key Features:
Accepts multiple symptoms from the user

Maps symptoms to possible diseases

Gives basic information, do’s and don’ts, and diet tips

User-friendly web interface for quick recommendations

How to Run:
Clone the repository

Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit application using streamlit run app.py

Enter symptoms and get instant health recommendations

Results:
The system successfully maps input symptoms to the most probable health issues. It then provides a short description, precautions to follow, and a recommended diet. This tool helps users take early precautions and promotes awareness.

Learning Outcomes:
Improved my understanding of rule-based health logic and disease classification

Learned to build clean and interactive UIs with Streamlit

Strengthened my Python coding, debugging, and deployment skills
